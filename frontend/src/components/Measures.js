        <h2>Understanding the Menstrual Cycle</h2>
       <p> The menstrual cycle is a natural process that occurs in the female reproductive system, typically lasting around 28 days, although it can vary from 21 to 35 days. 
       It involves the thickening of the uterine lining in preparation for a potential pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the lining is shed, resulting in menstrual bleeding.</p>

        <h2>Use sanitary products</h2>
        <li>
Regularly change sanitary pads, tampons, or menstrual cups to maintain hygiene and prevent infections. It's generally recommended to change every 4-6 hours.
Cleanse the genital area: Wash with mild soap and water at least twice a day to keep the area clean.
Avoid douching: This can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria and cause infections.
